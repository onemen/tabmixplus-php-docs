          Sometimes people complain about a Tab Mix Plus development version (or a release) being
          incompatible. You are welcome to try other,
          <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tab-mix-plus/versions/">
          older builds</a> but keep in mind that Tab Mix Plus is always compatible and always
          working, even with Beta, Aurora and Nightly, despite Firefox incompatibility
          warning you might be seeing.
          </p><br/>

          <p>
          Although older version may work for you without a problem it is very
          important that you report about any problem.
          </p>
          <p>
          The problem you encounter can be incompatibility with other extensions or a
          bug in Tab Mix Plus that only reveals itself in a specific Firefox and Extensions
          combination. Installing old version will not fix the problem.

          If you are testing pre-release Firefox versions, you really should install
          Disable Add-ons Compatibility Check, Add-on Compatibility Reporter, or simply
          <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=Compatibility">
          search AMO</a> for something similar, there's a whole bunch available now.
          While it may not eliminate the warning, it will allow you to install and use
          add-ons with pre-release Firefox versions.
          </p><br/>

          <p>
          Remember to always use the latest development version available with latest
          Firefox pre-release versions, let it be Beta, Aurora or Nightly.
