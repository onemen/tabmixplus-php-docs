          If the Error button in the Tab Mix Plus Options is visible, some of your
          extensions are incompatible with Tab Mix Plus. It is recommended you
          disable or uninstall the extensions in the list. Click the "Show
          Listâ€¦" button to do that.

          Conflicts have been reported with <b>Ubuntu Firefox Modifications</b>
          extension, so if you use Ubuntu, disable that one (you can read
          <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=826536">more here</a>).

          Conflicts with <b>BarTab</b>, <b>Colorful Tabs</b> and <b>Tree Style Tab</b>
          have been reported. Since all these extensions manipulate tabs, shouldn't be
          surprising. Don't panic, these conflicts are usually solved rather quickly,
          especially if good information is given (like errors in console, screenshots,
          steps to recreate, etc.). Feel free to post and provide as much info as
          possible.

          Issues with <b>MR Tech Toolkit</b> have been reported with Firefox 22 and up.
          Those are not Tab Mix Plus problems but rather MR Tech Toolkit. There's really
          no reason any longer to have MRTT installed - it hasn't been updated for years.
          Some of its functions are now Firefox default, others can be
