          <u>What will happen to my existing Tab Groups?</u>
          <p>
          When you update to Firefox 45, if your last session contained Tab Groups, Tab Mix Plus session manager will save a backup of your session.
          You can use it the same as you use all your other saved sessions.
          All your existing Tab Groups will be bookmarked automatically and stored in the Bookmarks folder.
          You will be able to access them by clicking the Bookmarks button in the toolbar.
