          If you are reading this page, you have probably encountered a problem with
          Tab Mix Plus. While it can be some unknown bug, most issues reported in the
          forum usually end up being extensions or theme conflicts.
          </p>
          <p>
          In order to identify and solve the problem there are several things you can do.
          </p><br/>

          <u>Install latest development version</u>
          <p>
          First, install the latest development version to see if the problem might have
          been fixed (there's always a development build sticky thread in the
          <a href="http://tmp.garyr.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=3">
          Builds forum</a>). You can reinstall the
          <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tab-mix-plus/">
          latest official version</a> in place of the development version later if you wish.
          </p>

          <p>
          If the latest development version still has the problem then the place to
          post about it is the development build sticky thread in the
          <a href="http://tmp.garyr.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=3">Builds forum</a>,
          but before you post there are a few more things to try.
          </p><br/>

          <u>Create new testing profile</u>
          <p>
          Create a  <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles">
          new profile</a> (Creating new profile is safe and doesn't have any effect on
          your current profile, which you can return to using once you complete testing
          the new profile), install Tab Mix Plus and import your preferences from the
          problematic profile. If you don't see the problem, it's most likely a conflict
          with another extension. Install your extensions one by one restarting in
          between until the issue reappears (once you isolate the conflicting extension(s),
          you don't have to use the new profile unless you want to).
          </p><br/>

          <u>Disable other extensions</u>
          <p>
          If you prefer not to create a new profile for testing, you can try disabling
          your other extensions in the current profile instead. Then enable
          each extension one by one and test for the problem.
          </p><p>
          Note: This is not as good
          as creating a clean profile because the conflict may be an option choice or
          another customization made in the browser and not another extension.
          </p><p>
          If you
          have a high number of extensions, a way to expedite this troubleshooting is to
          disable half of the installed extensions at a time. If the problem disappears,
          then you know that the conflicting extension is one of those you just
          disabled.
          </p><p>
          If this is still a high number of extensions, you can enable half of
          those extensions and check for the problem. If and when you get to a more
          manageable number of extensions, you can then enable/disable extensions one at
          a time until you isolate the one conflicting with Tab Mix Plus.
          </p><br/>

          <u>Reset your profile</u>
          <p>
          Finally, if nothing else works you can reset your profile, read the article

          </p><br/>

          <u>Report your finding</u>
          <p>
          When you finish your testing, we encourage you to report about your findings,
          whether you find the culprit or not, to our forum, so other users can benefit
          from your findings and to help Tab Mix Plus developers to solve the issue you have.
          (Read <a href="viewpage.php?t=2&p=how-to-post" target="tabmix-troubleshooting-content">How to post about a problem</a>).
          In the case the conflict is another extension or theme, please report
          about it to the developer of the conflicting extension or theme also so
          that they can work it out as well.
