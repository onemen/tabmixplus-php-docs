          <u>Sessions Manager backup</u>
          <p>
            Sessions are stored in the <b>session.rdf</b>
            file in your profile folder. A backup of this file is stored in the
            <b>sessionbackups</b> folder in your profile folder. If your session
            becomes corrupt and you are unable to restore that session, copy one
            of the backup files (tabmix_sessions-yyyy-mm-dd.rdf) from the backup
            folder to your profile folder, rename the file to <b>session.rdf</b>.

          <u>Sessions Manager extension</u>
          <p>
            For a full range of sessions managing features, you can use
            <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/session-manager/">
            Session Manager extension</a> which is created specifically for that
            purpose.<br> When Session Manager extension is installed, Tab Mix
            Plus turns its own session manager off. Your existing sessions will
            be converted to SM format. This two extensions work well together
            without any known problems.<br><br>
            <b><u>IMPORTANT!</u></b> If you uninstall or disable Session Manager
            extension, Tab Mix Plus will revert back to its file which will not
            have the sessions saved with Session Manager extension.
