          Sometimes your Tab Mix Plus options fail to be saved after you change them. For
          example, you may change a setting in the Tab Mix Plus Options window only to have it set
          back to its previous value when you reopen the Options window or restart Firefox.

          If you still have trouble keeping preferences from getting reset, try to
          temporarily disable your other extensions one at a time (restart Firefox after
          each extension you disable) until the problem disappears.

          Report to our forum if after you disable specific extension the problem disappeared.
