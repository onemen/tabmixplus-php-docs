            To create a screen shot of your entire desktop, press the "Ctrl-PrtScn"
            buttons on your keyboard.&nbsp; This will capture an image of your
            screen to your PC memory.&nbsp; Then launch some graphics program
            such as "MSPaint" (comes with all Windows O/S) and paste the captured
            image into "MSPaint".&nbsp; That file may then be saved as a .jpg or
            .png image to be posted.
            </li>

            <b>A better alternative</b> - To create a screen shot of a single
            window, dialog box, error message, etc., select the window to make
            that window have focus.&nbsp; Then press the "Alt-PrtScn" buttons to
            capture the image to your PC memory.&nbsp; Paste the captured image
            into "MSPaint" and save the file as a .jpg or .png image to be posted.
